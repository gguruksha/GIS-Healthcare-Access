# Mapping Access to Primary Healthcare in Washington, D.C.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes accessibility to primary healthcare facilities in Washington, D.C., using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and data analytics. It examines disparities in healthcare access based on location, transportation infrastructure, and socio-economic factors. The goal is to identify underserved areas and propose potential facility placements.

## Data Sources

- **Census Tracts Data** - Open Data DC
- **Healthcare Facilities Data** - Primary and Mental Health Facilities
- **Transportation Infrastructure** - Roads, Public Transport Access
- **Socio-Economic Data** - Income Levels, Population Density

## Methodology

### 1. Accessibility Scoring

- Weighted transport and healthcare facility proximity.
- Evaluated public transit routes and walkability scores.

### 2. Composite Index Mapping

- Combined socio-economic and accessibility data.
- Used GIS spatial analysis to map healthcare service gaps.

### 3. Optimal Facility Placement

- Identified underserved neighborhoods.
- Proposed new facility locations based on population density and need.

## Questions Answered

1. **Which neighborhoods have limited access to primary healthcare facilities based on proximity and available transport options?**
2. **How do socio-economic factors, such as income levels and age demographics, correlate with healthcare accessibility in the area?**
3. **Where would the placement of new healthcare facilities most effectively increase accessibility for high-need populations?**

## Key Findings

- **Areas with Low Accessibility**:
  - Eastern and Southeastern D.C. show the lowest accessibility scores.
- **Socio-Economic Disparities**:
  - Accessibility strongly correlates with income levels and demographic data.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Establish new healthcare facilities in underserved areas.
  - Improve public transportation and pedestrian infrastructure.
  - Implement policy initiatives targeting healthcare accessibility gaps.

## Visualizations

- GIS-based maps showing healthcare accessibility by region.
- Overlay analysis of healthcare facilities with population demographics.
- Suggested locations for new facilities to optimize access.
